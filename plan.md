# Project Plan

## 1. Requirements & Analysis
- Identify stakeholder goals and gather detailed feature requirements for backend, frontend, mobile and database components.
- Define success metrics and non‑functional requirements (performance, security, scalability).
- Produce an initial backlog and high‑level release schedule.

## 2. System Design
- **Architecture**: Choose a modular architecture separating the Kotlin/Gradle backend, Next.js frontend, Flutter mobile client and a relational database.
- **API Design**: Specify REST endpoints and data contracts shared between clients.
- **Database Design**: Model entities, relationships and migrations.
- **Technology Decisions**: JDK 17+, Node.js 20+, Flutter 3+, Docker, GitHub Actions.

## 3. Implementation
1. **Environment setup**
   - Install JDK, Node.js, Flutter SDK and Docker.
   - Configure local `.env` files for secrets and API endpoints.
   - Establish Git branching strategy and code review process.
2. **Backend development**
   - Scaffold Spring/Ktor modules, entities and repositories.
   - Implement authentication, business logic and database migrations.
   - Provide unit tests with JUnit and integration tests.
3. **Frontend development**
   - Implement Next.js pages, components and API calls.
   - Add state management, routing and responsive styles.
   - Write unit tests with Jest/React Testing Library and run ESLint.
4. **Mobile development**
   - Build Flutter screens and services that consume the backend API.
   - Add platform integrations (notifications, storage, camera).
   - Write widget and integration tests.
5. **Database & infrastructure**
   - Create schema migrations and seed data.
   - Provide Docker Compose for local services (database, backend, frontend).

## 4. Integration & Testing
- Merge features into a develop branch and run full test suites.
- Perform API contract tests between backend and clients.
- Execute end‑to‑end tests against Docker Compose environment.
- Collect code coverage and static analysis reports.

### Continuous Integration
- Use GitHub Actions triggered on pull requests.
- Jobs:
  - **Backend**: `./gradlew test` and static analysis.
  - **Frontend**: `npm ci && npm run lint && npm test`.
  - **Mobile**: `flutter test`.
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds and upload artifacts for review.

### Continuous Delivery
- On merge to `main`:
  - Build Docker images for backend and frontend and push to registry.
  - Run database migrations.
  - Deploy to staging environment using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
  - After manual approval, promote the same artifacts to production.
- For mobile, trigger release workflows that sign and upload builds to the app stores.

## 5. Deployment
- **Staging**: Deploy automatically on successful CI using environment variables and test data. Run smoke tests.
- **Production**: Deploy after approval, monitor with logging and metrics. Implement rollback strategy via previous container images.

## 6. Maintenance & Iteration
- Monitor errors, performance and user feedback.
- Schedule periodic dependency updates and security scans.
- Plan future iterations based on backlog and analytics.

## 7. Documentation
- Maintain up‑to‑date README and architectural decision records.
- Document CI/CD pipelines and deployment procedures for onboarding.
